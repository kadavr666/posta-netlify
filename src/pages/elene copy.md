title: "Elene Chantladze"
description: "The Artist Elene Chantladze (1946) lives on a health resort, Tskaltubo. Based on her desire to turn private or social occurrences into expressions, Elene Chantladze uses any found materials at hand – boxes for packing, surfaces of X-ray images, tops of the paints for house renovation. In publication, each image is accompanied by a back page, which creates a double, parallel narrative. The text about Chantladze’s work, too, presents a double narrative of two diverse visions, that of an artist and that of art theory. Works are presented in their original size, as most of them are in A3 or a smaller format."
